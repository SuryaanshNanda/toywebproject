     <h3>How I got into anime?</h3>
     <p> One day suddenly my roommate came up with this brilliant idea from somewhere that he wants to watch Naruto. He was watching it and I got this urge of reminiscing over shows from my childhood. I first started with Idaten Jump then Detective Conan. Shortly after the Pandemic came so I got more time in hand to go wild with the new found hobby.</p></div>

     <h3>Favourite Genres</h3>
